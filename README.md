## Development
> Note that this serves as a single node in the `Odyssey` system, where [Calypso](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Calypso) publishes decoded CAN data to the MQTT server and [Argos](https://github.com/Northeastern-Electric-Racing/Argos) visualizes the data broadcasted by the MQTT server

### Running with Docker
Coming soon.
