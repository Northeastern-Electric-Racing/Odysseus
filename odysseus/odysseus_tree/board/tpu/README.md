The bcm2711_defconfig file was sourced [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-6.1.y/arch/arm64/configs/bcm2711_defconfig).  
This file is edited upon in linux_merged.config for use with make linux-update-config.  
Note: fragments not used due to merge being one way (changes are not reflected back out of tree) and not working for in-tree defconfigs.
