In order to run the virtual environment from Powershell, run the following commands:
    - python3 -m venv env
    - activate

From Linux:
    - source env/bin/activate

Then install the required dependencies:
    - pip install -r ./Siren/odysseus/odysseus_tree/sources/tpu_telemetry/requirements.txt

Before you can use the publishing script, you must use Protobuf (must have the compiler downloaded and included in PATH. see tutorial: https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/pythontutorial/, and latest protoc release: https://protobuf.dev/downloads/) to serialize the data. Move into the publishing directory,
    - cd ./Siren/odysseus/odysseus_tree/sources/tpu_telemetry/telemetry  

and run the command
    - protoc --python_out="." "server_data.proto"

You're now prepared to work with the telemetry script:
    - python3 -m publish
