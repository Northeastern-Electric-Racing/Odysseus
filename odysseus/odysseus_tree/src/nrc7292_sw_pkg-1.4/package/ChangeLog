Change summary for version 1.4:

    New features
        * HaLow certification features
          o HaLow R1 mandatory features (v1.4)
          o HaLow R1 optional features (v1.4)
            - AP optional features: BSS color, fragmentation
            - STA optional features: MCS 3-7, NDP probing, A-MPDU TX
        * Kr00k vulnerability (v1.4)
        * Dynamic fragmentation (v1.4)
        * Network bridge (v1.4)
        * RSSI-based roaming (v1.4)
        * Duty cycle (v1.4)

    Changes
        * Support HaLow certification with the single firmware package
        * Regulation related updates
          (1) Updated JP LBT/duty cycle regulation support
          (2) KR channel update: K0/K1/K2 channels
          (3) EU channel update: remove 2MHz channel based on IEEE 802.11-2020
        * Firmware/host driver refactoring
        * Remove modem sleep feature
        * Support faster wake-up time in deep sleep mode
        * Support serial flash power down in the deep sleep mode
        * Support active scanning on mesh
        * Enhance duty cycle feature in terms of stability and monitoring
        * Update the maximum supported STA count from 1000 to 700 due to the increased heap usage in the firmware
        * Association control based on BSS max idle period and listen interval values
        * cli_app update (refer to UG-7292-007-Commnad line application v2.0 document)

    Bugfix
        * HSPI problem detection and recovery issue
        * hw_verion update error issue under frequent power on/off situation
        * Initialized aggregation/guard interval setting issue after target recovery
        * Default CCA level of 4MHz channel bandwidth
        * Fast synchronization of rx_slot count of host driver to avoid HSPI operation failure on the low-performance host platform
        * Unexpected operating channel change caused by self_config during JP 4MHz channel operation
        * Buffer mismatch triggered disconnection in the bridged node
        * Generating assert during the stop of relay node
        * Irrecoverable FW by mishandling of IP/DHCP/ARP frames in mesh and relay node
        * Long beacon_int compliance in TIM mode deep sleep
        * Imbalanced uplink/downlink performance at the repeater mode * lay) node
        * Host driver build error in the Linux kernel version 4.4 or lower
        * Incorrect 1MHz primary channel location and primary channel number
        * Inflexible S1G format for probe response frame
        * Inflexible 1MHz control response support
        * Fail to set output of relevant GPIO before entering the deep sleep
        * Mesh control field correction to consider 4-address usage
        * Multicast frame drop on JP channel

    Known Issues
        * Not Support 5 US channels due to hostapd channel capacity reason
          (Not supported channel: 100(BW_1M, 925.5MHz), 104(BW_1M, 926.5MHz),
          108(BW_1M, 927.5MHz), 112(BW_2M, 927MHz), 116(BW_4M, 926MHz))
        * Due to the legacy Wi-Fi/HaLow channel mapping, "hostapd_cli chan_switch" command can’t be applied to following radar channels:
          5500(#100/925.5MHz), 5520(#104/926.5MHz), 5540(#108/927.5MHz),
          5560(#112/927MHz), 5580(#116/926MHz)
        * DHCP failure or delay in multi-hop MBSS
          (Recommend using static IP in more than 3-hop MBSS)
        * Not supported on KR MIC package
          (The concurrent mode can’t be applied due to the KR MIC regulation)
